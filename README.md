Brendan Billingsley's [home page hosted through github pages](https://billingb.github.io/)

Currently hosts my resume at [https://billingb.github.io/resume](https://billingb.github.io/resume)

## Development setup:
This repository is rendered by github using Jekyll, a good getting started guide is available at: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/

To get things running on a development machine first install bundler, `gem install bundler`. Then run `bundle install`. Now you can run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve the site at localhost:4000 with rebuilds automatically occuring whenever any files are changed.
