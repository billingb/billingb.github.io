  description: The bowling challenge is my solution to a code challenge provided as part of an interview process. It was
               written in the language and style of my choice, TDD and Node.js. The bowling challenge is a command line
               javascript application that scores a game of bowling, taking in integers and printing the score for the
               game when complete.

  description: A large project at NSIDC to provide two interfaces for search and discovery of
               scientific data. NSIDC Search exposes NSIDC held datasets. Arctic Data Explorer is an
               interface for arctic datasets from roughly a dozen data centers. Both interfaces share a common code
               base and depend on shared REST services. I contributed to this project as architect and as a
               full stack developer on an agile team. Most of the code repositories are open source, however when they were
               open sourced the history was deleted so it isnâ€™t possible to find my commits.

  description: NCEI Common Ingest is a data file ingest system that includes file transformations and processing. The
               project was established before I joined NCEI. After the 2015 work the system was recognized as a leading
               solution in NCEI for data ingest and has been adopted by other NCEI sites for handling data ingest. This
               was made possible by design refactoring I led in 2015 which drastically reduced the cost (estimated 10x)
               of adding new data streams to the ingest system. NCEI Common Ingest is a private project.

  description: Real time processing system for GOES-R satellite data. This system monitors the file system to process
               incoming data files through roughly 25 separate algorithms. The project coordinates the algorithms but algorithms
               them selves were created by another team. SPADES Control Segment is a private project.
