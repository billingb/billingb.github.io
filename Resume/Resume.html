        <p class="summary">Full stack developer on an agile team developing multiple products supporing ingest, archive, analysis,
          discovery and extract of scientific data. Highlights include:</p>
        <ul class="square">
          <li>Led a successful effort for estimated 10x reduction in software team development effort when adding a new
            data stream to the enterprise data ingest system. This transformation was accomplished by changing from a custom
            code per data stream approach to a composition approach using configuration available in a UI.
          </li>
          <li>Transformed engineering practices of the team including better javascript development skills, testing
            consistency and agile planning practices. Working closely with a coworker we introduced continuous delivery
            build pipelines to all projects. This included adding javascript build, linting, unit testing and e2e
            testing for javascript applications and adding linting and e2e testing for groovy applications. These
            improvement changed the cycle time for feedback on development throughout the life cycle significantly
            improving productivity for the whole team.

          <li>Created a new Search web application for dataset discovery implemented as a SOA architecture with two
            other developers and the frontend development coordinated and shared between two teams. Backend services
            implemented in Ruby with Sinatra using Solr and Postgres. Frontend implemented as a backbone.js application.
            Entire stack implemented using TDD.
          </li>
          <li>Created a web application with three other developers for managing metadata for ~600 datasets in Ruby on
            Rails with backbone.js for parts of the interface. Application manages datasets through published states and
            implements an immutable data model for data sets to preserve history of published records. The application
            includes user management.
          </li>
          <li>Architect and lead developer for a new web applicationi, Searchlight, for search, interaction,
            manipulation and download of NSIDC raster and point data. Java application implemented using Hibernate, JPA,
            Struts 2 and Spring. GIS and data manipulation relies on GDAL, the Java Topology Suite and the netCDF Java
            library. The web interface uses JQuery, proj4js and OpenLayers.
          </li>
          <li>Received CIRES Service Award for accomplishments on Searchlight project.</li>
          <li>Led adoption of agile methodoligies and structure including leading Scrum adoption, working as a scrum

          </li>
          <li>Designed a new database schema in PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions for storage of NSIDC data set and
            file level information. Created stored procedures and triggers to automatically update aggregate
            denormalized data for quick searching.
          </li>
          <li>Created and led a seminar class for NSIDC developers to teach Java basics, debugging, unit testing,
            Hibernate, JPA and Spring.
          </li>
          <li>Created and led a seminar class on PostgreSQL and how to use PostgreSQL from Perl (DBI), Ruby (Rails) and
